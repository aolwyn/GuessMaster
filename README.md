# GuessMaster
GuessMaster is a game programmed in Java where the player attempts to guess a celebrity's birthday. The player tries to guess by typing his/her answer in the following format: ”DD/MM/YYYY”. Where DD is for day, MM is month (a preceding 0 will be used for days and months less than 10, ex. Jan 1 is 01/01), and YYY is the year.
